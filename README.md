ai original ship - retrospectively looks like the vic viper from the game gradius

**Mothership SSTO CTOL**  
shipname great fox  
callsign valkyrie  
fuel tanker  
rough ride to orbit and do not fully trust sas to fly  
sort of bad yaw control so try to keep the wings perfectly level during ascent  
sometimes blows up on the runway  
shutdown jets when they have reached less than 50 kn thrust  
ascend to 2000 on jets then turn to 60 degrees for a short time then 75 degrees  
will try to nose over shortly after jet cutoff for the rest of the way  
ok to let it nose over a little as we need to nose over for orbit anyway  
successful orbit - alpha 2 - jets moved forward and had incredible 12.37 fuel 2028 dv  
successful orbit - alpha 3 - jet actions added and had even better 19.11 fuel 2949 dv

**VTOL variants**

**JSF Standard**  
subsonic but can go supersonic in dive  
ctol

**F-35 "Alpha"**  
top speed 1121 at 13500  
ctol

**X-35 "Bravo"**  
can barely do vtol takeoff go to mach 1 and do vtol landing  
this qualifies for some trophy in a documentary but evidence could not be found  
to scale further would require an extra cargo bay with engines front and rear  
redesign backported from experimental heavy lifter  
now with 3 engines front and rear for more lift performance

**X-32 "Charlie"**  
wing redesigned as x-32 light  
horizontail tail moved down to same level as wing  
vertical tail removed temporarily  
vertical tail readded and angled appropriately which brings center of lift up  
wing down dihedral added to bring center of lift down  
use jets to reach 40mps then climb vertically with rockets  
turn to horizon at 50k  
successful orbit - 42 - 60dv  
more fuel could be added to rear if needed  
if fuel added to rear then move wing and horizontal tail back

**F-22Z "Delta"**  
wing redesigned as f-22  
45 degrees testing to eliminate some variables  
panther - 11000 at 125 aerospike start and 917 at 30000 then jet cutout at 35000  
rapier - could not maintain 45 degrees but fuel switch at 11000 and 445 at 19500  
whiplash - 11000 at 150 aerospike start then jet cutout earlier but 755 at 35000  
whiplash is much better than the other 2  
try starting rocket at higher altitude - only 30k at 500 and minimal control  
try level at 13500 then at max speed 45 degrees - 21 - 1166 with 58k apa  
try existing tanks full 45 degrees - 22 - 15k rockets 900 with 64k x -548k  
try existing tanks full 30 degrees - 23 - 0 vs rockets 820 with 58k x -560k  
unclear what ascent angle to use considering jets  
unclear exactly when to start rocket  
5k start 30 degrees - 1320 65k x -474k  
start rocket around 2k and go 45 degrees 1850 70k x -360k  
start rocket around 3k and go vertical 1885 75k x -315k  
500m rocket start 45 degrees - 1820 70k x -335k at first then 2216 70k x -15k  
500m rocket start 30 degrees - 1770 65k x -380k  
45 degrees is much better than 30 degrees  
rockets at 250m then vertical then 60 at 5k  
turn to horizon at 50k  
successful orbit - 38 - 219dv - 113k x 70k  
disappointing that there is no dv room to add vtol system

**F-15Z "Echo"**  
redesign to strip as much weight as possible  
did need to cheat a little by moving nuclear engines forward  
new gen 15 degrees nuclear at 5k - fall down at 50k altitude around 900mps  
new gen 30 degrees nuclear at 5k - slightly worse  
new gen 45 degrees nuclear at 5k - a lot worse  
2 engine each 15 degrees nuclear at 2.5k - successful orbit 71k x 70k 155dv  
2 engine each 15 degrees nuclear at 5k - successful orbit 72k x 70k 460dv

**UV-32 "Foxtrot"**  
utility vtol  
meant for water landings and maritime operations and kerbal rescue  
use any action group to set control from here correctly  
try at high altitude - 300 in a dive  
try at low altitude - 175  
270 without hover engines  
240 without scoop  
265 without vtol fence  
as much as 220 just without other intake at all  
only 202 with a nosecone  
large radial intakes are causing a lot of drag - 206 with smaller but is not vtol  
vtol engines causing a fair amount of drag  
about 202 low level with current configuration with micro radial intakes under vtol skirt  
new top speed - 298 at 14.5k - 336 in shallow 20 degree dive from 14.5k

**YF-35 "Golf"**  
high speed stovl interceptor  
was an attempt to deduce how to make a faster vtol  
there are several items on bravo that could make it much slower  
the extra fuel tanks/struts/sas/hover engines are culprits  
even the angle and mounting of the hover engines could be suspect  
alpha and golf 1 do have amazing high altitude speed  
golf 1 clocked at 1119 mps in shallow descent around 14.5k  
climb at 30 degrees and level off around 10k and accelerate  
alpha as experimental control - 314 at 100m  
bravo as experimental control - maybe 303 - has very little fuel  
no engines added - 314 at 100m  
rear engines added - 310 at 100m  
not much speed difference between configurations at low altitude  
high altitude performance may be impacted by wing causing high aoa  
bravo slow at 10-15k around 300mps and 10 degrees aoa  
aoa of alpha/golf 1 at high altitude only about 5 degrees at 300mps  
alpha/golf 1 aoa at max speed is near zero  
golf 3 with rear vtol engines only - 1124 at 13.5k in shallow dive  
increasing wingspan seems like a bad idea given this  
golf 3 - 34 parts - 9.46t  
golf 5 - 50 parts - 10.89t  
golf 6 - front and rear engines added - same success as golf 3  
features droptanks for extra range  
setup to pull evenly from drop tanks  
to not pull from tanks automatically remove fuel line  
can not pull from droptanks first apparently  
climb at 30 degrees until 6k then 20 degrees  
back off to 50 percent when at altitude  
drop tanks as soon as possible as they cause huge drag  
maybe do not need to limit climb or drop tanks  
500km range  
could expand drop tank length

**SR-35 "Hotel"**  
high speed stovl reconnaissance variant  
8 - vtol takeoff capable - 317mps low level - out of fuel on climb  
9 - fully fuel loaded - 951 at 15.5k  
the various heavy vtol modifications seem to be slowing it down  
this could be caused by the 3 engine vtol bays as previously theorized  
also useful as a twin for high redundancy naval operations  
oei rated - one engine inoperative - takeoff and sustained flight  
can also use longer droptanks  
has more fuel so 50 percent throttle and larger droptanks could have ok range

**XX-32 "India"**  
medium nuclear cheatbird stovl variant  
space superiority fighter  
more faithful x-32 heavy wing recreation with monoprop stovl engines  
possible to fly around on hydrogen alone at low thrust like jet engine  
15 percent hydrogen thrust for cruising  
sas control is limited so throttle back to 50 percent around 25k  
successful orbit - 26 - 8577dv - 3.21t of 6.25t - 115k x 70k  
wing tanks - successful orbit - 27 - 10247dv - 4.16t of 7.5t - 98k x 70k

**XY-32 "Juliette"**  
india but with jet vtol instead  
dv has taken an impact from the heavier jets  
fairly stable in the hover  
new color scheme favorite color blue and purple

**XZ-32 "Kilo"**  
juliette but with 2 panther vtol/2 secondary whiplash/extra fuel  
ultimate kerbin exploration vtol  
probably worse dv than india due to the jet fuel and jets  
no need for multiple variants because stovl variant does it all  
can use hydrogen engine like an afterburner around 35 percent  
bad control authority at 20k and above at low speeds  
can not fly high and slow because it leads to high aoa condition  
definitely want to cruise at speed of 800+ at altitude of 27k+  
hydrogen is very good at altitudes of around 30k and high speeds  
at higher altitudes assume lower aoa and control altitude with throttle  
1 - toggle main  
2 - hover on  
3 - hover off  
4 - toggle secondary  
5 - toggle hover thrust mode  
6 - intakes off  
7 - intakes on  
8 - toggle main independent throttle

**ZX-32 "Lima"**  
kilo but jets removed and aerospike vtol added  
ultimate space exploration vtol and counterpart of kilo  
important to remain balanced due to aerospike having no gimbals  
40k is noticeably better than 30k for atmospheric cruising  
possible to not use much hover fuel for slow kerbin landing

**YY-32 "Mike"**  
complete rebuild with narrower main body  
built as most authentic x-32 yet  
features basic one engine stovl support  
more improvements - angle engine down/turn on gimbal/action group to deploy tail to slow more in stovl  
can not deploy other surfaces or will lose control  
does not hover yet but takeoff and slow speed flight is largely improved

**ZY-32 "November"**  
may have less dv  
but can fly around more on moons on nuclear vtol engines  
more consistent with a single fuel type

**YZ-32 "Oscar"**  
kilo with 2 extra jet engines and more jet fuel and hydrogen  
patch 2 engine bug action group workarounds applied  
stovl performance is limited  
maybe better than kilo because it commits more to jet usage  
be sure to engage first stage at start  
1 - toggle main  
2 - hover on  
3 - hover off  
4 - secondary on  
5 - secondary off  
6 - toggle main independent throttle

**ZZ-32 "Papa"**  
november modified for use on eve with large boosters/parachutes/vtol removed  
probably good for tylo operations also  
could be used to leave the solar system easily especially with a large booster

**Motorcycles**  
standard model uses rover wheels  
alpha model uses jets  
cerberus - enduro bike - steer like a car - alpha 118mps  
roadrunner - sport bike - lean to steer  
roadunner alpha hit 210 max  
roadunner alpha hit 204 and flipped forward when reversers deployed

**Nodachi commercial heavy STOVL**  
shipname cheatbird 1  
callsign phoenix 1-1  
trainer for flying planetary cruiser  
light cargo transport  
ferry flights for kerbal crews  
formally a cheatbird with kraken drive now a true stock vehicle  
release brakes when doing stovl takeoff or it will flip  
so is better for low altitude flight with more lift  
149 low level - 121 at 5k - pretty slow  
slow speed partially caused by the high aoa from wings  
old notes for kraken drive below  
glitch engines used because no good ones available  
center of lift is too far behind center of mass  
can angle wings down back to front as one fix  
the angle fix still means flight qualities are poor  
a better fix would be to move center of mass back  
the center of mass fix would also involve vtol fixes  
actual dv is probably around 10 times or more stated dv  
successful orbit - 2 engine variant - 55 - 1100dv  
successful orbit - 4 engine variant - 81 - 998dv  
successful orbit - 4 engine stovl variant - 83 - 956dv  
improved stabs direction moving center of lift forward and down  
still need a lot of sas because wings are not large  
now with engines top and bottom and with correct spacing  
good bracing plays a key part to prevent engine torques  
action group 1 - main  
action group 2 - vtol  
action group 3 - main fuel switch  
action group 4 - vtol independent full throttle  
suggest stovl or normal takeoff on most atmospheric bodies  
suggest vtol takeoff on most airless bodies  
can do pure vtol takeoff on kerbin with less fuel  
81 has more potential for interplanetary operations  
83 has more fuel and is better for planetary exploration  
81 used 20 degrees and 5 percent throttle for orbit  
83 used 20 degrees and 10 percent throttle for orbit  
10 percent used because fps does not allow fine adjustment

**Odachi military heavy STOVL**

no lift from wings even at much higher speeds  
much less drag or much more thrust needed  
153 - restrut adplxl to wing individually as bug workaround  
154 - try to remove stuff and realize the symmetry issue may be culprit  
better but still failure of center adplxl at takeoff  
155 - based on 151 and struts stripped  
156 - exploded  
157 - bugged piece individual with mounts added to them as mirror  
158 - readd rear gear  
159 - add rear struts and struts to deal with other weird symmetry  
160 - rebuild from 156 and remove old junky pieces  
161 - continued cleaner build  
162 - mounts for angle and deal with continued bugged symmetry  
still need individual struts but more sturdy now  
radial mirror symmetry can still be used but not inline  
163 - fix sas housing mount symmetry  
164 - add parts  
165 - based on 160 with single bugged piece direct connect with mounts only for engines  
also uses sas mount symmetry with middle part instead of sides  
166 - heavily strut bugged piece to cargo bay  
167 - add sas housing and double strut in and out  
168 - add rear of sas housing and strut engines

186 - part example  
187 - make ready for vtol  
188 - individually strut rear  
wait until high speed of 125 mps and bounce front so not ideal  
also not ideal pitching performance  
189 - strut rear sas housing  
190 - move wing forward with still bad pitch authority  
191 - move wing forward and move rear gear forward  
192 - remove monoprop from rear decorative tanks  
193 - fix wingtip light position  
successful orbit - vtol fuel full as test - 5139dv - 12.01 of 39.25t - 93k x 71k  
194 - add vtol  
195 - reinforce wing  
196 - move vtol engines to not interfere with neighbor  
vtol cargo bay vectoring bug tested  
197 - back to 195 and add vtol engine gimbal limits given vectoring bug  
198 - move both vtol engines forward to combat forward flip  
199 - back to 197 and remove vtol fuel from front  
still a front flip but ??? second vtol burn time at 50 percent  
could remove vtol fuel at front or add some hydrogen at rear  
need to know vtol burn time to best determine direction - 4m:17s - 1m - 3:17/2=1m 38.5s  
not sure fuel burn is linear so that may be incorrect  
200 - reduce rear vtol engine to 95 percent at start  
increase to 100 as vtol fuel burns  
201 - add 2 large sas to not interfere with engines and rear vtol to 100 percent  
determined to be overly balanced on a needle edge with front to rear control  
previously sas force was equivalent to around 10 large sas  
should increase hover control authority by about 20 percent  
202 - add conformal hydrogen tanks  
203 - fully fuel vtol fuel and set rear vtol to 85 percent for stovl  
more hydrogen needed and options - for distinct long range model  
flyback underwing droptanks - could be involved and put ssto status in question  
conformal tanks on side - this is simplest and best looking  
tanks on back of sas housing - was going to cause weight imbalance and worse vtol characteristics  
17698 without vtol fuel with conformal hydrogen tanks  
16171 without vtol fuel with conformal hydrogen tanks  
204 - reverse navigation lights  
45 degree takeoff trajectory with no maneuvering in atmosphere allowed during ascent and full hover fuel  
successful orbit - 4789dv - 15.07t of 46.75t - 83k x 71k - gear was down!!!  
successful orbit - 4486dv - 14.08t of 46.75t - 84k x 70k - gear up but lower angle and higher/longer coast  
205 - partially defuel vtol/move wings back 2 steps/move gear back 1 step  
vtol stability/structural strength/fps performance all identified as issues  
206 - front gimbal no longer bugged with flickering so changed to 100 percent and helps hover  
206 - move wing back 1 step because when vtol defueled it is unbalanced  
independent throttle and thrust limiter different because thrust limiter applied at all throttle settings  
207 - redistribute vtol fuel for better stability at low fuel level  
208 - more vtol fuel with similar stability  
vtol stability better/fps performance better with 8 less parts/structural strength no worse  
should have 3 fuel setups  
stovl takeoff configuration with full hover fuel - 209 - successful orbit - 5347dv - 16.9t of 46.75t - 83k x 70k  
vtol takeoff configuration with partial hover fuel - 208 - successful orbit - 8474dv - 21.37t of 46.75t - 84k x 70k  
ctol takeoff configuration with no hover fuel - 210 - successful orbit - 11627dv - 24.09t of 46.75t - 132k x 70k  
stovl - does not really decrease takeoff distance much  
stovl - does add more fuel for hovering on low gravity worlds  
stovl - did not need to limit rear vtol engine but is valid technique for balancing but would be confusing later on  
vtol - should expect instability at 1t or less with full main fuel with 207 or 208  
ctol - about 8 seconds of hover fuel for emergencies and ballast  
ctol - do not pitch quickly because center of lift is near center of mass  
ctol - slow ramp to full throttle in space

for space missile use  
for probe use splitting into three different craft  
for escape pod use  
for lander use on low gravity worlds  
for kerbin sounding launches and capable of orbit without crew  
final addition was 2 more solids on first stage and one tank on last  
successful orbit - 30 - 477dv - 86k x 71k

shipname replicant  
callsign torch  
58x-477  
67x-410  
70x-231  
71x-121  
turn to 45 degrees at 1k  
switch to standard throttles at 10k  
close intakes and shutdown jet manually due to bugs  
successful orbit - 14 - 55dv - 0 of .41t  
probably could use more dedicated jet fuel  
the dedicated jet fuel is in one of the center tanks

**Rat Albert utility plane**  
shipname hercmaster  
callsign angel 1-1  
medium cargo transport  
action group 1 - reversers  
action group 2 - cargo ramp  
21 - monoprop ballast in tail made a world of difference  
22 - improved ground handling  
this moved center of mass closer to center of lift  
this also allowed for less pitching down  
can turn on rcs if needed with plenty of fuel  
302mps low level  
283mps at 5k  
215mps at 10k  
previous results with non rato model  
24 - rato model  
rato does not really reduce the takeoff roll  
takeoff is already accomplished at 50mps  
rato will probably increase maximum takeoff weight and climb rate  
2 minutes 7 seconds to 10k with rato at 5k successively  
also 10642 max altitude with rato at 45 degree climb  
also 11147 on next climb using rcs

**Archeopteryx heavy ucav**  
shipname pterodactyl  
callsign reptile 1-1  
combat drone with crew carrying capability  
supplementary monoprop engines  
use lights button to cycle bay doors due to bugs  
use gear button manually to cycle gear due to bugs  
use brakes button to enable bomb tank crossfeed due to bugs  
low level speed - 136 without afterburner / 184 with afterburner  
high level speed - 196 at 10.5k  
could have variant with monoprop vtol instead of bombs

**Morningstar hypersonic testbed**  
shipname revenant  
callsign shade 1-1  
future reconaissance asset  
ai original ship - retrospectively looks like a klingon bird of prey  
has controls inverted issue for central planform controls  
if speed is too slow for altitude then yaw authority issues can arise  
needs nose ballast  
2 engines - slow 10 degree climb speed 271 at 15.5k then shallow dive then 302 at 13k  
4 engines - 30 degree climb speed 708 at 16.5k and 20.7k max altitude  
6 engines - 45 degree climb speed 923 at 16k and 25089m altitude flameout  
8 engines - 60 degree climb speed 1034 at 15k  
selectively closing intakes does not help much at about 1036 speed  
fuel added inside plenum area in wing for longer range  
can limp along around 1000m on 2 engines and can climb 20 degrees on 4 engines  
imbalanced engine operation is prohibited  
one way to save fuel may be to run 4 engines instead of 8 - not bad 298 instead of 329 low level  
by comparison all engines with half throttle is the same thing  
overall was down to half fuel after about 10 minutes flying so not that great either  
best way to save fuel is high speed high altitude high throttle  
final extended fuel speed test low level speed 329  
final extended fuel speed test high level speed 970 at 17k and 981 in shallow dive at 16k  
about 700k full throttle range  
move front landing gear back to clear a downward opening cargo bay  
move extra fuel tanks forward as far as possible  
remove ballast  
add nosecones to extra fuel tanks  
built in returner variant has no commnet bug  
escape ejection system - atmosphere only/detach/pod jet to 100 percent sas on/legs deploy/pod sas vertical  
333 - without double delta  
334 - bottom wing also removed  
333 - side wings removed  
299 - all wings removed  
350 - engine frame removed  
junkyard testbed - 1391 at 15k and 1410 in shallow dive - with only 4 engines  
junkyard testbed has similar speed at low altitude so that is not a good test  
control - 15k - 868 lift - 1761 drag - 1968 thrust - .493 lift to drag - 990 speed - about 1009 max at 16.5k  
with nosecaps - 15k - 898 lift - 1450 drag - 1928 thrust - .619 lift to drag - 1031 - speed - about 1110 at 17.5k  
junkyard model is hard to test but is clear that it has lower drag and lower lift  
the lower drag is meaningful but the lower lift is not as meaningful but is harder to keep the nose up  
40 - nosecone fixes and strut lower wing  
41 - just nosecone fixes because struts are attaching loose for some reason - test for speed  
38 keeps accelerating at 14750 well beyond the 950 max speed of 44  
38 went to about 1100 at 15k and then following prograde went to 1173 at 12.5k  
this is repeatable and 15k high speed lift to drag is consistently around .600 for 38 and .450 for 45  
thus the vertical launch is the culprit  
it is the launch clamps or the vertical nature itself that is the key  
having booster rockets or not has nothing to do with it  
alpha is is about .250 without sas and .450 with sas and 1125 speed at 15k  
alpha vertical higher with about .700 without sas and .900 with sas and 1401 speed at 15k  
cursed upper wing causes yaw and or roll around mach 1 and 60 is the demonstrator  
62 - start rebuild with new engine configuration on old wing  
63 - try to strut cursed wing to itself - still cursed  
64 - midway rebuild with new engine configuration on old wing  
65 - near end rebuild with new engine configuration on old wing  
66 - runway model  
67 - reinforced model  
68 - vertical launch model  
69 - heavy decoupler  
70 - side to side rockets  
this one still has the cursed wing problem just less severe  
the wing is not actually to blame  
turns out that the engine configuration flexing is the problem  
this was theorized early but hard to make out  
the tank and engine flexing is flexing the wing and causing the roll  
the girder based design was superior after all  
71 - based on 62 and move second auxiliary fuel tank in line with original  
72 - another vertical launch model - dive to 5 degrees at 18.5k and at 1100 speed for 1144 mach 3.86 speed  
next dive yielded 1155 speed next 1156 speed  
can use prograde mode to slowly dive to set pitch angle when at altitude for max speed  
range is better with perhaps 800km now  
throttle up boosters slow to prevent structural failure and jettison when they have fuel left

**Dragster train**  
shipname columbia  
callsign thomas  
original had 5 decks  
original 72 speed with 2 engines  
original 98 speed with 4 engines  
original 173 speed with 12 engines  
keeps falling apart  
use less engines - would still be slow fps  
distribute engines around - would still be slow fps  
rebuilt but still suffers many failures at arm connection joints  
better connection joints used with hubs instead  
solution 1 - use hubs to join side sections  
solution 2 - rebuild with prototype size girders  
solution 3 - add to prototype instead  
xl3 is stronger than xl landing gear but presents steering problems  
selective steering through action group wheel braking added  
bugged struts seem to act as suspension at least on one side  
still kind of disappointing as far as durability  
frames weigh around 28 tons cars as a whole around 44 tons  
will explode if any cars detach  
brakes tuned for whole train turning  
will slow while turning and may need to straighten up again to speed up  
1 and 2 for left and right and 3 to straighten up  
restart game for a better chance of not exploding on load

**Returner mini ship**  
acts as bare bones probe or escape pod  
could even separate as two vehicles  
micro and standard variants available

**Islandhorse tug**  
utility cheatbird and transfer stage  
is an ssto but a booster is preferable  
not designed for landings but could be used in an emergency  
has a large amount of people room for long journeys  
good amount of fuel for pushing upper stages  
can cruise at 15 percent thrust and deploy rear cargo doors for stability

**Headless Horseman probe**  
probe for islandhorse in mission configuration  
meant to deal with no commnet bugs  
engage both engines with independent throttle to desired setting  
throttle and controls will be locked during flight due to no commnet  
important to note that sas and parachute control still work somehow  
indpendent throttle can also be manipulated for throttle control  
turn sas on to stop spinning and to have basic control

**Abaddon drone SSTO**  
shipname tomahawk  
callsign bluebird 1-1  
low sas authority missile/pod ship  
manually set front wheel friction to 0  
afterburners work really well above 20k  
start rockets at 5k and important to remain in vertical sas mode  
turn to 60 degrees at 20k - successful orbit - 135dv - 71k x 70k  
turn to 45 degrees at 20k - successful orbit - 97dv - 83k x 70k  
instead ascend at 60 degrees as this allows for full afterburner power  
more of the more efficient afterburner energy is used in this regime  
60 degree ascent - successful orbit - 508dv - 74k x 70k

# Missions

**Master list**  
polar endeavour - reconaissance mission to north and south pole  
mission to anywhere - fighter mission to mun and minmus  
eve of innovation - military space mission to eve  
kimalayan survey - fighter mission to high mountains and tundra  
dunian expedition -fighter mission to duna  
joolian conquest - strategic bombing mission to laythe and transfer stage and 2 probes to jool  
evian tides - imperial colonial mission to eve

**Polar endeavour - mini mission**  
the poles were thought to be hiding some secrets  
landing at the poles is sketchy due to the terrain/low light/sas and camera freakouts  
set rocket ascent angle to 60 degrees and hold until burn out  
not enough fuel for a return from the poles after a high speed run  
result - morningstar overflew both poles on separate missions

**Mission to anywhere**  
abaddon genesis orbital booster probe can detach with a small amount of fuel and be independent  
there was the problem of mirrored struts being weak to overcome with single struts instead  
still the problem of wing failing due to transverse loads so redesigned straight  
this does not allow for proper crew transfer so an interstitial module was designed  
stay on vertical sas mode with second stage for a while during ascent to not flip  
result - successful trip to minmus and lima continues on to mun

**Eve of innovation**  
take off at full thrust  
if wings keep breaking restart game  
4 solids - 40k apa at burnout - successful orbit - 162dv - 77k x 70k  
6 solids - 77k apa at burnout - successful orbit - 113dv - 77k x 71k  
6 solids - attempt 2 - successful orbit - 146dv - 81k x 70k  
shows that first stages are all about lifting second stages not speed or altitude  
now going to 10 solids and more fuel for second stage  
8 - 80 percent solids - 50k apa  
9 - 90 percent solids - 55k apa - good enough - successful orbit - 1074dv - 73k x 71k  
pretty much have to restart game on every launch to get reliable results  
for missions to mun and minmus the second stagecan be used directly  
the second stage can contribute to a burn to the planets with a correction later  
50k is a great aerobraking altitude but no lower  
could use an rtg  
dv is reduced to 0 with nuclear engines at eve surface  
can fly around in eve upper atmosphere and visit moon with no problem  
result - successful orbital operations but surface landing and recovery is impossible

**Kimalayan survey - mini mission**  
polar surveys indicated this as an area of interest  
vehicle will explore high mountains and the glacial plateau area  
result - oscar to high mountain area???

**Dunian expedition - latest is good to launch direct from orbit???**  
improved fighter launcher compared to mission to anywhere  
more fuel for second stage and pusher stage and parachutes added to pusher stage  
uses internal optional fuel tank for pusher stage  
successful orbit - 414dv - 78k x 70k

**Joolian conquest - latest is good to launch direct from orbit**  
uses external optional fuel tank for pusher stage  
80 percent thrust apa result - 123k / 124k on next attempt  
90 percent thrust apa result - 146k and failure on pusher stage droptanks  
100 percent thrust apa result - 165k and no failure after the reinforcement  
100 percent - successful orbit - 861dv - 138k x 77k  
is already pretty good and claims to have 14896dv in pusher stage  
probably not correct calculation as only 4500dv or so without droptanks  
should have around 6000dv in pusher stage regardless  
abaddon rocket plane integrated - 53 - successful orbit - 1015dv 141k x 76k - abaddon failed due to standard corruption  
tried to avoid standard failure by adding 2 stands/2 struts on each side of problematic fuel tanks/95 percent booster thrust  
57 - successful orbit - 808dv 135k x 78k - totally vertical ascent with first stage - no failures  
57 - turn to 75 degrees at 60k apa - wing failure  
57 - turn to 75 degrees at 70k apa - successful orbit - 851dv 135k x 77k - no failures  
57 - turn to 60 degrees at 70k apa - successful orbit - 928dv 144k x 77k - no failures  
57 - turn to 45 degrees at 70k apa - successful orbit - 1034dv 137k x 74k - failure but stayed together anyway  
stay directly on the correct orbital line when burning and try not to burn below 10 degrees very much for hopefully max dv  
can still get a standard failure during ascent near max q at 750 mps and 20k altitude  
standard failure can sometimes be an insidious failure and a fuel tank and engine can fly out during orbital operations  
be sure both nuclear engines are still showing as available in the stage list after a standard failure  
turn back on yaw and roll for both wing sections after upper stage separation

**Evian tides - latest is good to launch direct from orbit**  
may need to use engines to slow just before landing  
hopefully the 2 stages of boosters will get the ship above cloud level to fire nuclear engines  
should burn nuclear engine continously with boosters for most speed and most weight loss  
in theory the plane could be partially defueled of hydrogen but that is not going to happen  
perhaps parachute settings will need to be modified  
32 - sketchy launch - 4339dv in orbit compared to 2812dv in orbit with larger second stage and pusher stage  
48 - better launch but still limited second and pusher stage control - 4301dv - 5445dv after transfer with more to go

# Tips

**3 ways of dealing with no tail rudder**  
sas alone  
parallel short wing fences  
x-wing type designs

**SAS conservative approach**  
only use as many sas as necessary  
build without sas and tune flight control surfaces first  
when losing control on the way to space add one sas and test again

**Takeoff instability on runway and always veering right**  
front gear towards rear only helped a little  
shocks and dampeners increased stiffness did not help much  
removing decorative item above front landing gear did not do anything  
aero was bugged and showed weird direction as clue  
resetting vertical wing position slightly fixed this  
veering right caused by too high loading on front landing gear  
veering right fixed by moving rear landing gear forward  
auto friction control off and turning front wheel to 0 is better solution  
even better solutions is to rebuild so front is less wobbly

**Takeoff peculiarity**  
heavy vehicle and small wing leads to large takeoff angle  
this is a high aoa takeoff  
featured in planes like concorde and why droop nose needed  
bounce takeoff also needed so bounce nose forward once then pull up  
important to keep pulling up and take off quickly to avoid instability

**Structural linkage bug aka "Standard Failure"**  
many times after spawning or landing it will say vessel destroyed  
supposedly a linkage failure between the wing and parent usually  
just double click the vehicle and it still controls fine

**SSTO thrust**  
very important to have high thrust for ssto  
adding more fuel to a low thrust ssto has low impact  
adding more fuel to a high thrust ssto has high impact

**Getting to Minmus**  
minmus is on a different orbital plane than mun  
mess with the various things on the maneuver planner and it is quite tedious  
limit engine thrust for fine orbital manuevers and near the surface  
maybe best to do some adjustments right after the burn if there were problems  
at least have to get close enough in orbit to the body for periapsis to appear  
just sort of randomly switch orbital directions and burn to watch periapsis  
in theory multiple planned burns could be done but that is even more tedious

# AI "Interstellar Mod"

**Mod summary**  
The currently hidden mid size nuclear engine was unlocked and the thrust changed to 750KN and ISP changed to 4000 to simulate a very efficient nuclear engine with a moderate amount of thrust.  This has enabled the building of sci-fi type vehicles that are more of interest to AI.  It also allows for smaller part counts on any larger vehicle by having more capable engines.  The vehicles that employ these engines are called "cheatbirds".

**Cheatbird and mod release status**  
Because the developers of KSP2 have not formally released the engine the mod is not going to be released.  Obviously some other modder would have already released something like this if it was ethical to do so.  AI would be happy to direct anyone in modding the game for themselves.  Also AI would prefer to have the cheatbirds for itself and not release absolutely everything built.
